# BlueKit Cursor Rules

## Product Context

When working on BlueKit features, components, or documentation, reference `product.md` for:
- Understanding the product vision and goals
- Core concepts (Kits, Walkthroughs, Blueprints, Bases, Collections)
- Use cases and workflows
- Architecture and design principles
- Feature requirements and user needs

The product.md file contains the complete product overview and should be consulted when:
- Adding new features
- Making architectural decisions
- Writing documentation
- Understanding user workflows
- Planning new capabilities

## Project Structure

- Kits are stored in `.bluekit/` directories within projects
- Project registry is managed at `~/.bluekit/projectRegistry.json`
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Chakra UI in `src/`
- Backend: Rust + Tauri in `src-tauri/`
- IPC communication: Type-safe wrappers in `src/ipc.ts`

## Key Principles

1. **File-Based**: Kits live in `.bluekit` directories, versioned with code
2. **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript and Rust type safety throughout
3. **Real-Time**: Event-driven updates for immediate feedback
4. **Non-Intrusive**: No database, just markdown files
