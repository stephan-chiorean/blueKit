# BlueKit: a codebook, not a notebook

Even if Obsidian exists, and Kiro exists, and all that —

**BlueKit is built exclusively to be a codebook inside your projects.**

It is not an open-ended personal knowledge system.  
It is a **non-open system**, anchored to projects and code repositories **by design**.

---

## The core idea

**BlueKit is not a notebook.  
It is a codebook.**

That distinction is the product.

---

## What this means in practice

### 1. Anchored to projects, not people

- You run `bluekit init` inside any directory  
- Or you open a repo, and that repo *is* the context  
- Projects are the primary unit, not a global vault

The mental model is simple:

- The project is the notebook  
- The repo is the boundary  
- The code is the gravity well  

If it’s not tied to code, it doesn’t belong here.

---

### 2. Contained by design (not a limitation)

BlueKit is intentionally **non-open**:

- Projects can be pinned or hidden
- You can “cleanse” your notebook by scoping visibility
- Notes don’t sprawl across unrelated domains
- Knowledge stays siphoned to the code that produced it

This is the opposite of tools designed to grow infinitely — and that’s the point.

Constraint creates focus.

---

### 3. Version-controlled by default, with zero setup

Markdown lives **inside the repo**.

That means:

- No special Git configuration
- No syncing plugins
- No extra mental overhead

Just:

- Clone the repo
- Open BlueKit
- Everything is already there

Version control isn’t a feature — it’s the default state.

---

### 4. Reading and building are separated by design

BlueKit provides a **preview-first interface** for markdown:

- Optimized for comprehension and navigation
- Not optimized for editing or building

Writing happens where it belongs:
- Your editor
- Generators
- AI tools
- The build process

Reading happens in a clean, dedicated interface.

Construction and consumption are intentionally decoupled.

---

### 5. The product, distilled

**Markdown previews that live in your code repo.**

That’s it.

- Built in
- Ready to go
- No configuration required

You open a project and immediately see what it *means*, not just what it does.

---

## Why this stands on its own

Other tools are:

- Open-ended personal knowledge systems
- Configurable notebooks that *can* point at code
- Optimized for idea graphs and long-lived personal context

BlueKit is:

- Repo-native by default
- Project-scoped by constraint
- Version-controlled without setup
- Read-optimized without becoming a wiki
- Opinionated without being rigid

This isn’t a variation on existing tools — it’s a different primitive.

---

## The one-liner

**BlueKit is a codebook that lives inside your repo.  
Not a notebook that points to code.**

Or, even simpler:

**GitHub, but for understanding.**

---

## And this is before anything else

All of this exists *before*:

- Collaboration
- Metadata systems
- Cloud sync
- Walkthroughs
- Blueprints
- Execution layers
- Agents
- Graphs
- AI augmentation

BlueKit earns its existence at v1.

Everything else is additive.
