Basically the idea is can we simplify everything across the board when it comes to toolkit

we want to be able to link any doc to any task, and have multiple tasks linked to the same document or multiple documents linked to the same task. 

so that consolidates tasks/plans

the other thing is we need context traversal to be seamless. by design we've separated things in terms of **kits** and **walkthroughs**, is this maybe too limited?

maybe we want to flatten things a little for just a concept that emphasizes portability between projects

these are the templates you can index and move across projects. because they don't need to be in folders anymore. they can just be anything that was designated as a block. 

what would we do first, handle the migration and link tasks/notes
