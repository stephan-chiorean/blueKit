# Human Understanding First

The explosion of AI coding tools has led to countless solutions for "context management for AI," but they're solving the wrong problem. The real issue isn't whether Claude or Copilot has enough context - it's whether **you, the developer**, can maintain clarity about:

- Why architectural decisions were made
- How different parts of the system connect
- What patterns work well in this specific codebase
- Where critical business logic lives
- What tradeoffs were considered and rejected

As projects scale, that human understanding fragments. You might remember the shape of code you wrote last week, but what about:

- The system someone else built 6 months ago?
- The reasoning behind that "weird" pattern in the auth flow?
- How the new feature you're building should fit the existing architecture?

**BlueKit is fundamentally about human memory and understanding, not AI context windows.** The AI benefits are secondary - the primary value is giving developers a lightweight, code-adjacent way to capture and rediscover their own knowledge.
