# Core

## How it Works Section:
Every project gets a notebook

Publish key resources to your core library 
  Show icons here going into a library. so a kind of flow diagram

  Every project gets a notebook: project + notebook, project + notebook, project + notebook, etc

  From there you have arrows from the project notebook couplings that show icons flowing into a bucket/toolkit/suitcase/library type thing

  and then from there arrows to like 50 other projects. with some kind of message about cross polinating across projects




The flow in order:

  You and your IDE agent collaborate on your integrated code notebook.
