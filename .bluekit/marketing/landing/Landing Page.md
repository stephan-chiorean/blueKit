## The Code Notebook

A notebook designed for real code.

blueKit lives **inside your projects** — not in a separate app, not in a global vault.

Each project stays **isolated by design**, so context is never polluted.  
When something’s worth keeping, extract it. Reuse it. Share it.

Study real code.  
Capture what you learn.  
Build a library of patterns, walkthroughs, and decisions over time.

Share with teammates. Publish to your community.  
Let knowledge compound — project by project.
