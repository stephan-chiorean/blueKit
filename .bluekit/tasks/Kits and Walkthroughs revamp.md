# Kits and Walkthroughs revamp

Yeah — it does make sense, and honestly it’s already pretty strong. Let me break it down clearly and then point out where it almost becomes great vs where it could get confusing.

⸻

What’s working really well ✅

1. Mental model is clean
	•	Groups (folders) on top
	•	Actual kits (documents) below

That hierarchy reads instantly:

“These are my categories → these are the reusable building blocks inside them.”

That matches how your brain thinks about kits already.

⸻

2. Table layout > cards (for this use case)

You were right to move away from cards.

Tables are better here because:
	•	Kits are functional objects, not inspiration content
	•	You want scanability, not browsing vibes
	•	Name + description + tags + updated = perfect density

This feels pro-grade, not “notion-y”.

⸻

3. Sidebar reinforces the ‘codebook’ idea

The left sidebar being literal folders:
	•	agents
	•	diagrams
	•	features
	•	investigation
	•	kits

That’s huge. It anchors BlueKit as:

“This lives inside the repo. These are real artifacts.”

Very different from generic notes apps.

⸻

4. Tags are doing the right job

Tags feel:
	•	Secondary (good)
	•	Functional (filtering, scanning)
	•	Not screaming for attention

They support the content instead of becoming the content.

⸻

Where it almost breaks (and how to fix it) ⚠️

These are subtle, but important.

⸻

1. Groups vs Kits needs one more visual distinction

Right now:
	•	Groups = folder rows
	•	Kits = document rows

They’re separated vertically, which helps — but they still feel too similar.

Suggestion (lightweight, not heavy):
	•	Give Groups a slightly different row style:
	•	Softer background
	•	Slightly taller rows
	•	Or a faint divider label like GROUPS

You want zero confusion about:

“Am I looking at containers or content?”

⸻

2. The “Groups 7 / Kits 15” labels are good — but underpowered

This is actually a great concept that just needs a touch more intention.

Right now they’re informational.
They could be navigational.

Ideas:
	•	Clicking Groups collapses/expands that section
	•	Clicking Kits jumps to kits
	•	Or show a subtle summary:
“7 groups · 15 kits”

Small change, big clarity.

⸻

3. Empty “Updated” fields feel a little broken

Seeing - everywhere creates a subconscious “unfinished” feeling.

Options:
	•	Hide the column when empty
	•	Or show:
	•	“—”
	•	“Never”
	•	“Untracked”

This is tiny UX polish, but it matters.

⸻

4. Search bar intent isn’t fully clear yet

“Search Project…” at the top is fine, but:

Ask yourself:
	•	Does this search kits only?
	•	Groups?
	•	Files?
	•	Entire repo?

You don’t need to solve this now — but eventually the label or placeholder might want to evolve to:
	•	“Search kits, groups, files…”
	•	Or context-aware search depending on view

⸻

Big-picture verdict 🧠

This layout absolutely makes sense for what BlueKit is trying to be.

More importantly:
	•	It does not feel like Notion
	•	It does not feel like Obsidian
	•	It does not feel like a docs app

It feels like:

A structured, repo-native code notebook for serious builders

Which is exactly your positioning.

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Stress-test this with 100+ kits
	•	Design drag & drop between groups
	•	Or design what opening a kit feels like (this is where the magic really happens)

You’re on the right track. This is already quietly elite.
