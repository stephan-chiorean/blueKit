Kits are single files. There is never a reason for kits to be folders. This is a weakness and complexity of skills to deliver progressive disclosure. Kits are meant to be marked as templates to serve as building blocks in other projects. There's no reason for them to be split into separate files. They are meant to be primarily consumed by AI.

Walkthroughs are directories of files. This allows for progressive disclosure. A walkthrough can be a single file, but it will always be contained within a folder. Walkthroughs have database-backed metadata (similar to Plans) to track progress, complexity, and format. The only way to create a walkthrough is to convert a directory into one.
